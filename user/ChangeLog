2010.09.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* The example SecondCycle configuration uses LOCAL mode once
	  again. Unfortunately PROOF(-Lite) doesn't play nicely with
	  relative file paths.

2010.08.16 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Put a security check into FirstCycle::EndMasterInputData(...).
	  This way when the worker nodes die, the master process is
	  still able to collect the messages from the workers.

2010.06.30 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated FirstCycle to show off some of the new features of
	  the framework.
	* Modified JobConfig.dtd to adhere to the new design of
	  SInputData.

2010.05.20 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the SkipValid property to the InputData definitions
	  in the DTD
	* Added some explanation about this property to
	  FirstCycle_config.xml

2010.04.30 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Revived the <DataSet> node in the DTD which I actually left in
	  it the last time I tried to implement the support for
	  PROOF (PQ2) datasets.

2010.04.13 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated the DTD to know about the new <MetadataTree> input
	  type. Removed the EVInputTree parameter from the DTD, which
	  is not supported by the code since a while.

2009.11.20 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated the DTD and configuration files to account for the
	  updates made to SInputData. A short description is available
	  for the "Cacheable" property in FirstCycle_config.py.

2009.08.19 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Removed the LeakCheck cycle, and the associated files.
	  These are now put into a new package called
	  SFrameStressTest.

2009.02.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Removed my specific configuration from FirstCycle_config.xml
	* Added some more documentation to the same file

2009.01.22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Adopted the FirstCycle configuration to the latest core
	  changes.

2009.01.05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified FirstCycle_config.xml and SecondCycle_config.xml to
	  work with ROOT 5.20 and newer versions by default. If you
	  use an older version of ROOT, you should modify the configuration
	  files as instructed in the comments, to run the example
	  cycles.

2008.12.02 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Speeded up the examples a little bit

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added example usage of "NEventsSkip" to FirstCycle_config.xml.

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended FirstCycle to give examples of how to use
	  boolean properties.

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Very small changes in the documentation...

2007.11.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the location of the example input file in
	  FirstCycle_config.xml. The file is put on AFS now,
	  so anyone could run the example out of the box.

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFrameUser" library.
	* The package holds two example analysis cycles that
	  can be good starting points for newcomers.
	* Cleanded-up and extended the descriptions in the
	  XML configuration files a bit.
