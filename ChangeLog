2010.05.12 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made the code aware that ROOT version "5.26/00-proof" can also
	  handle multiple datasets per query (per InputData).
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-07

2010.05.05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the SH1::Fill(...) function to throw an exception
	  when it receives a NaN value. (Instead of plainly crashing.)
	  This should make debugging a little easier, as the code now
	  reports which histogram received the NaN value.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-06

2010.05.03 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added some fixes after trying to run some "real" jobs on
	  PROOF (PQ2) datasets.
	* SCycleController now automatically specifies to PROOF which
	  TTree the cycle should run on. If it's not specified for a
	  D3PD file for which an event selection was applied in Athena
	  (CollectionTree has more entries than the D3PD tree), then the
	  job crashes.
	* Disabled the checking of the metadata trees when running on a
	  dataset. The current implementation of PROOF doesn't catalog
	  the TTree-s inside subdirectories of a file, so the PROOF
	  dataset doesn't know about these metadata trees. This cataloging
	  should be added in a future version of PROOF.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-05

2010.04.30 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added first implementation to support PROOF (PQ2) datasets in
	  the InputData.
	* Created a new singleton class (SProofManager) to handle the
	  PROOF connections. Moved some of the functionality that was
	  previously in SCycleController, to this new class.
	* Added a new class to SInputData (SDataSet), and updated all the
	  classes to know about this new member of the input data.
	* Removed the dictionary generation for SCycleController. This
	  was left in the code by mistake, there is no need to have such
	  a dictionary.
	* Revived the <DataSet> node in the DTD which I actually left in
	  it the last time I tried to implement the support for
	  PROOF (PQ2) datasets.
	* Created a small script (sframe_clear_server.py) that can be used
	  to clear a PROOF server of all the uploaded PAR packages (of the
	  given user). By default packages are only updated on the server
	  if they change locally. But this mechanism doesn't like it when the
	  user removes a source file locally from a package. That source
	  file will remain on the server after the next update. If this happens,
	  this new script can be used in an easy way to "reset" the server.
	* Made sframe_dset_maker.py more usable, by making sure that files
	  hosted on an xrootd server can indeed be added to datasets.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-04

2010.04.30 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated the Doxygen documentation a bit.
	* Not tagging for the moment...

2010.04.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a check in SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable(...) that makes
	  sure that the user tries to connect the correct type of variable
	  to a branch. Previously it was possible to try to connect a
	  primitive variable (bool, int, etc.) to a branch holding let's
	  say a vector<double> variable. In this case ROOT crashed in a
	  quite undecipherable way in the ConnectVariable(...) function.
	  This should not happen anymore, the code will exit with an error
	  message if the user makes this mistake.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-03

2010.04.13 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new configuration option to the XML files: <MetadataTree>
	  Using this the user can access additional TTree-s in the input
	  files which don't hold event-level data. The used case for this
	  right now is to be able to read the trigger configuration
	  metadata from the D3PD ntuples.
	* Added a new function in SCycleBaseNTuple to give access to the
	  metadata trees.
	* The metadata trees can also be in subdirectories inside the file,
	  just like it is done with the trigger configuration metadata
	  right now.
	* Updated the DTD in the example to know about the new <MetadataTree>
	  input type. Removed the EVInputTree parameter from the DTD, which
	  is not supported by the code since a while.
	* Modified the source code created by sframe_create_cycle.py a little
	  bit once again.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-02

2010.04.09 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed the way SCycleBaseConfig handles the case when it receives
	  an empty string as a vector property. (Now the std::vector remains
	  empty.)
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-01

2010.04.08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created a non-const accessor to the SCycleConfig object
	  of the cycle. This can apparently be used to modify the total
	  luminosity of the cycle for the re-weighting in a nicer fasion,
	  but that doesn't work with PROOF yet...
	* Added a new feature to SCycleBaseConfig: It is now possible to
	  add and retrieve TObject based "configuration objects" to/from
	  the cycle. The model is that the user creates/initializes a
	  configuration object in BeginCycle(), and adds it as a configuration
	  object with AddConfigObject(...). Then the user can retrieve
	  this same object inside the function which are executed
	  on the worker nodes, with GetConfigObject(...). The first example
	  is sending a TGoodRunsList object to the workers, to select
	  the good luminosity blocks out of ATLAS data.
	* This feature needed some modification in SCycleBaseExec, and
	  SCycleController as well.
	* Added some "friend ..." lines to the cycle base classes to make
	  it possible for the new classes in plug-ins to function.
	  I might get rid of these "friend ..." declarations and make all the
	  used functions public in a later release...
	* Created the SToolBase class: This class could be used to
	  create "smart classes" easily. These tool classes can use
	  much of the same convenience functionality as their parent
	  cycles can. But of course they have to be attached to a
	  parent cycle, to make it possible to run them.
	* Created the SInputVariables class: This base class should make
	  it simpler to create classes that serve the only purpose to
	  collect input data variables. This design makes it simple
	  to pass around input variables between different parts of the
	  analysis code. (After a long circle we came back to the
	  original design of SFrame...)
	* sframe_new_package.sh creates a package that produces a library
	  without the SFrame prefix now. This was just causing way too
	  many problems on PROOF.
	* Removed the annoying problem with sframe_create_cycle.py, that
	  it put "import" instead of "include" in the created header
	  file.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-03-00

2010.03.02 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made a few smaller changes to revive the SFrameARA packages.
	* SInputData::ValidateInput() is now aware of the persistent
	  trees. The same holds for the TTree information caching.
	* Made SCycleController play nicely with persistent
	  trees.
	* Made the PARHelers.py code a bit more flexible to be able
	  to create PAR packages from CMT packages.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-02-00

2009.11.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Revived the ISCycleBase class. Now it should be possible once
	  again to write custom cycle base classes in external packages.
	  (Like how the Manchester group does it...)
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-01-00

2009.11.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated the file information caching in SInputData to
	  save TDSet objects as well. This means that when running
	  with PROOF, neither SFrame nor PROOF will check the files
	  after they've been checked in a previous running.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-00-06

2009.11.20 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the capability to "cache" the information about the
	  InputData configuration locally. This means that the input
	  files don't have to be validated at the beginning of each
	  job, which can save many-many minutes in larger jobs.
	* The feature is turned off by default, it can be enabled
	  by adding Cacheable="True" to the InputData definition in
	  the configuration XML. See the example configurations
	  for more details.
	* The cached information is stored in the same way that
	  PROOF stores information about datasets. But by using our
	  own solution, the jobs can still be run without requiring
	  a PROOF server.
	* Removed the possibility of defining EV input trees for a cycle.
	  The framework didn't support such trees ever sice moving to
	  using PROOF anyway.
	* Added the possibility to use various std::map types with
	  SSummedVar. These can be very handy when calculating
	  event selection efficiencies for instance.
	* Updated the DTD and example configuration files to account
	  for the updates made to SInputData. A short description is
	  available for the "Cacheable" property in FirstCycle_config.py.
	* Added some small changes to the sframe_dset_*.py scripts,
	  mostly inspired by the PQ2 tools.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-00-05

2009.09.17 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed a problem with using PROOF machines/clusters with
	  a large number of worker nodes.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-00-04

2009.09.15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the SH1 class to the plug-ins library.
	* Not tagging at the moment.

2009.09.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added Ryan's suggestions to sframe_input.py and SFrameHelpers.py.
	  This includes the ability to specify the name of the main TTree
	  in the input files, and a nicer printout of the luminosity
	  if the input files.
	* Also added a prefix options to sframe_input.py. This can be used
	  to create file names such as "root://mymachine.cern.ch//data/file1.root",
	  where "/data/file1.root" is the absolute path name of the file
	  on mymachine.cern.ch.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-00-03

2009.09.10 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed a crash on SLC4 when shutting down a PROOF connection.
	* Removed the debug symbols from the sframe_main executable
	  compilation
	* Taggins as SFrame-03-00-02

2009.09.07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified Makefile.common to correctly link the libraries on
	  64-bit Mac OS X as well.
	* Tagging as SFrame-03-00-01

2009.08.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Validated the code a bit more, and maximised the number of
	  messages that the worker nodes print about their memory
	  consumption. (A maximum of approximately 10 messages per
	  query now.)
	* Cleaned out the unnecessary things from sframe_main.cxx
	* Tagging this version as SFrame-03-00-00

2009.08.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Merging SFrame-PROOF-branch back into the trunk.
	* The code now compiles and runs, but I'll only tag it once
	  I read through the code carefully. Shouldn't trust
	  "svn merge" too much...

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified Makefile.common and PARHelpers.py to work with
	  MacOS X + ROOT 5.24. Although I consider this modification
	  a decrease in the flexibility of the compilation system...
	* Removed "-g" from the compilation options, because debug
	  information should not be needed all the time.
	* Tested the code both with 5.24 (where MacOS X shows the same
	  problems as SLC5 now...) and 5.22. Both with PROOF-lite
	  and a proper PROOF cluster (which is running the trunk
	  version of ROOT), in all possible combinations of the above.

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* "Backported" the code to work with ROOT 5.22d. (Should work
	  with all 5.22X versions...)
	* Tested the basic functionality on SLC5 with gcc43.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-11, since it should already
	  be usable with this ROOT version.

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Checking in some preliminary python scripts for managing
	  data sets on a PROOF cluster. The scripts are not at all
	  production-ready yet...

2009.08.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* I believe I found the main memory leak in
	  SCycleController::ExecuteNextCycle(...). Thanks a lot
	  for Gerri Ganis for his help.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-10

2009.07.20 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small changes here and there while looking for more memory
	  leaks.

2009.06.23 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* First modifications in the SVN repository...
	* Fixed multiple memory leaks in SFrameCore
	* Disabled compilation warnings when running an SFrame job
	  on a real PROOF cluster.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-09

2009.06.15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing a crash in SCycleBaseExec...

2009.06.15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added some modifications to try to make sure that all files
	  that are opened, are really all closed. Even though the
	  old code should've done this already...
	* Not tagging at the moment, first Akira should test if this
	  solved his problems...

2009.06.08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made the PAR file creation in Makefile.common smarter.
	  Now the PAR files are only re-made if the respective
	  shared library has to be re-made. Thanks to Akira for
	  the suggestion!
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-08

2009.05.13 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified SLogWriter such that it now only prints the
	  output in different colours if it's being printed on
	  the console. This makes the logfiles easier to read.
	  Unfortunately it also has the sideeffect that all output
	  from the worker nodes appears colourless...
	* Changed SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable so that it now
	  returns whether it was successful or not.
	* Thanks to Alexander Mann for both of these suggestions!
	* Removed a hard-coded "include/" from Makefile.common
	  and replaced it with "$(INCDIR)". Thanks to Mark Andrew
	  for pointing this out!
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-07

2009.05.06 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable so that it now
	  it returns whether it was successful or not. Thanks to
	  Alexander Mann for the suggestion!
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-11

2009.04.07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Simplified connecting to input branches which are arrays
	  of primitives. The standard ConnectVariable(...) function
	  could not be used easily for this.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-06

2009.03.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the SCycleBaseHist::Hist(...) function to be a bit more
	  robust.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-05

2009.02.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Cleaned up the example cycle configuration a bit.
	* Fixed a problem in SFileMerger where the code would crash
	  in case of not writing out any entries to the output TTrees.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-04

2009.01.22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Tested the code on a realistic PROOF setup after a long time
	  only running the code on PROOF-lite. This required some
	  changes in the temporary ntuple writing department, but
	  nothing serious.
	* Added a new Cycle property (ProofWorkDir) to make the
	  temporary file handling as flexible as possible.
	* Updated the FirstCycle example to use this new property.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-02

2009.01.21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added some more documentation
	* Fixed some problems which only surfaced when using the code
	  in a realistic analysis.
	* Now the worker nodes print messages with the same verbosity
	  level as the master node.

2009.01.08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a *lot* of new code. I'll only try to list all new
	  features here, I'll probably forget a few...
	* The weighting should now work correctly even when running
	  on PROOF.
	* The meaning of the InputData Type and Version properties
	  have changed a bit. Now you can set both properties to any
	  string. (You have to set Type="data" to get 1.0 for weight.)
	  The InputData-s are only treated to be the same if both their
	  type and version is the same. This makes it possible to have
	  different output files like this for instance:
	  <InputData Type="data" Version="Muon_run8XXXX" ...>
	  <InputData Type="data" Version="Egamma_run8xxxx" ... >
	* PROOF now creates temporary output files for the output
	  ntuples. This is a relatively new feature in PROOF, and
	  required quite a bit of coding on the SFrame part... :-/
	  All other output types are still kept in memory until being
	  written out on the client machine at the end of an InputData.
	* The behaviour with defining multiple InputData nodes with the
	  same type and version is now the same as it is in "classic"
	  SFrame. (The luminosities of the separate IDs are added up,
	  and their content ends up in the same output file.) However
	  the implementation is radically different. Instead of keeping
	  an output file open when switching to a new ID, the old
	  (previously closed) file is appended with the contents of the
	  new ID when the processing of that ID finishes on the PROOF
	  cluster. There's quite a bit of ROOT magic involved...
	* Output file names should resemble the old type of names a bit
	  more now.
	* Only tested the code with GCC 4.3 and ROOT 5.22 on SL5 for
	  the moment. ROOT 5.22 is a strict requirement for
	  PROOF-Lite to work.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-01

2009.01.05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added GCC 4.3 related fixes.
	* Updated example configuration files to work with
	  ROOT 5.20 and 5.22 by default.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-09

2008.12.01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added SFrame-PROOF development code to the
	  SFrame-PROOF-branch branch.
	* The code is *very* experimental at this point.
	* The NEventsSkip functionality will have to be added later
	  on to the branch.
	* SFrameARA will not work with the branch at this point
	* PROOF-Lite does work when compiled against
	  ROOT >= 5.21/06

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new XML property for <InputData>, "NEventsSkip".
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-07

2008.03.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Now linking sframe_main against libutil
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-05

2008.02.15. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new python script/module.
	  (sframe_create_cycle.py/CycleCreators.py) They can be
	  used to quickly add a new analysis cycle to an already
	  existing user library.

	  There has been such code in the old SFrame CVS tree,
	  but that never got updated to the new features.
	  This implementation is maybe a little shorter, but
	  not by much... :-P
	* Added Wolfgang's suggestion to
	  SCycleBaseNTuple::OpenInputFile.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-04

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended SCycleBaseConfig
	* Fixed compilation problem from SCycleBaseNTuple
	* Extended FirstCycle
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-03

2008.02.08. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new feature to sframe_input.py: It is now able to
	  create <In> XML nodes from "data" files. (I used it
	  with streamtest files.) When using this option,
	  the user doesn't have to define a cross-section.

2008.02.04. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing compilation against 32-bit ROOT binaries on a
	  64-bit system.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-02

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added python script/module. The script can be used to
	  create <In ... /> XML nodes for analyses in an
	  automatised way.
	* Changed how the Doxygen documentation is made. The
	  Doxyfile file is now in the main directory, and it
	  requires version 1.5.4 of Doxygen. (Available under
	  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/doxygen/1.5.4.)
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-01

2008.01.25. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Introduced all the changes needed by SFrameARA.
	* All the changes should be backward compatible with
	  existing user code.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-00

2007.11.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small updates to core/ and user/
	* Version used for writing the documentation on the TWiki
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-01

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the re-organised SFrame
	  source.
	* It is divided into 3 separate libraries:
	  - SFrameCore: Holding the framework base classes that
	                normal users should not touch.
	  - SFramePlugIns: Holding useful tools for analysis.
	  - SFrameUser: Holding the user analysis code.
	* The idea is that the user can take the "user/" directory
	  as a starting point for creating an analysis in SFrame.
	  The directory can be copied out of its default location,
	  after being modified it can be checked in to the users
	  private CVS space, so can be handled pretty independently
	  of the rest of the SFrame code.
	* Not obvious how to write multiple user libraries that include
	  header files from each other at the moment.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-00
