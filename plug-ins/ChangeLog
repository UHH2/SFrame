	* Added a new class: SSummedVar
	  It can be used to wrap different kinds of integer numbers,
	  making it possible to "count things" when running in
	  PROOF mode. For an example see the FirstCycle class.

	* Added a lot of Doxygen documentation to the code, as
	  it is now also parsed.

	* Created first version of the "SFramePlugIns" library.
	* The package should be a collection of useful tools
	  built on top of SFrame/ROOT.
	* As a placekeeper, I added the good old SParticle class
	  to the library.
