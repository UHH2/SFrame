	* Hiding the Cintex code from the compiler when ROOT 6 (or newer)
	  is used.
	* Hiding the auto-generated .pcm file from SVN.

   * Making the PROOF files aware of the ROOTPROOFLIBDIR environment variable,
     which can be used to specify a common library directory that should be
     searched for libraries on a PROOF cluster with a shared filesystem.

   * Enabled keyword expansion for the Cintex source files. Should've been done
     ages ago...

   * Updated BUILD.sh not to compile the code when running on PROOF-Lite

	* Created a new SFrame sub-package as MacOS X wasn't playing nicely with
	  SFrameCore enabling Cintex at loading time. Somehow the
	  ROOT::Cintex::Cintex::Enable() command messed up the memory when
	  sframe_main was starting up.
	* This package makes it possible to have sframe_main load the library after
	  the ROOT services are already up and running in the background.
	* To use the Cintex functionality (because you use the ATLAS offline environment
	  for compiling SFrame for instance) then you have to load this library explicitly,
	  by putting the following lines into your configuration XML file:

	   <Library Name="libSFrameCintex" />
	   <Package Name="SFrameCintex.par" />
