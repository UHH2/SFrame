2007.11.22. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a *lot* of Doxygen documentation to the code.
	  Added a new directory called "doc/" which contains a
	  single header (mainpage.h) by default, and in which
	  the HTML documentation is put by Doxygen when calling
	  "doxygen" in the current directory.
	* Added a file called "Doxyfile" that describes the
	  project to Doxygen. It is currently configured to use
	  a tool called "dot" to create the graphs for the
	  documentation. Unfortunately it is not available on
	  SLC by default, but it can easily be installed. To
	  disable the usage of "dot", change the line in the
	  configuration file

	    HAVE_DOT = YES

	  to

	    HAVE_DOT = NO

2007.11.20. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Disabled the "parameter-less" running of sframe_main.
	  Now one always has to define exactly one XML file on
	  the command prompt, else the usage help is printed.
	* Added the possibility to use a new feature of ROOT.
	  (Awailable in ROOT >= 5.17/04) This new feature makes
	  it possible to use a bit more complicated XML files
	  for configuring the job. It is only used when compiling
	  against a proper ROOT version. (Pre-processor
	  conditional statements rule...)

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFrameCore" library.
	* The makefile also automatically compiles and links the
	  "sframe_main" executable. One shortcoming is that
	  "make clean" doesn't delete the executable...
	* Added appropriate headers with the SFrame authors to
	  all the files.
	* Used a little C++ magic in SCycleBase to make it impossible
	  for the users to call internal functions of the class that
	  they're not supposed to.
