2009.04.07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Introduced a new specialisation of
	  SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable(...). It allows to
	  connect to array inputs very easily. Some documentation
	  about its usage can be found in the source files.

2009.02.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed SFileMerger to be able to handle empty TTrees.

2009.01.22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new Cycle parameter: ProofWorkDir
	  It specifies where the temporary ntuple files should be
	  put when running on a PROOF cluster. The point is that
	  this location should be writable by all machines taking
	  part in the PROOF running.

2008.12.02 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Now the job automatically prints the output messages
	  from the worker nodes once the event processing is done.
	* Created a new function called SErrorHandler. It can
	  be used to print the ROOT messages using SLogger.

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the feature to skip events at the beginning of
	  an InputData. The property to specify in the header of
	  the InputData configuration in XML is "NEventsSkip".
	* Updated the format of the output messages during event
	  processing.

2008.03.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added libutil to the list of libraries that sframe_main
	  is lined against. (Needed when compiling with gcc >=4.1)

2008.02.14. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Now SCycleBaseNTuple opens the input files through
	  TFile::Open(...) rather than creating a TFile object
	  itself. According to Wolfgang, SFrame should play more
	  nicely with dCache and Castor like this...

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new type of property: bool
	  Such properties can now be used in the same way as all
	  the others. See the Doxygen documentation for details.
	* Removed "u_int" in SCycleBaseNTuple.icc that caused problems
	  on MacOS X 10.5 / ROOT 5.18.

2008.02.08. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed bug in SCycleBaseExec that caused a crash when
	  running over multiple InputData of the same type.

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Removed the Doxyfile file from this directory and put
	  it directly under SFrame/
	* Updated/extended the documentation in a number of files.

2008.01.28. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added memory consumption and memory leak DEBUG printouts.
	  (Should be useful for finding problems with code.)
	* Added new function (SCycleBaseHist::Write(...)) for
	  persistifying non-TH1 objects in the output. (Putting
	  a special emphasis on persistifying TGraph-like
	  objects.) Usage instructions are in the Doxygen
	  documentation.

2008.01.25. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made big structural changes in the SCycleBase class.
	  - The SCycleBase class doesn't hold any code itself now,
	  but is "just" a composite object made from the
	  various SCycleBase* classes.
	  - Introduced a new class, SCycleBaseExec. Its function
	  is to provide the event looping functionality to
	  SCycleBase.
	  - All components of SCycleBase have an interface class
	  now. SCycleBaseExec can access the other parts of the
	  SCycleBase object through these interfaces. If the
	  functionality of SCycleBase has to be extended, it's
	  enough to create a new kind of SCycleBase class that
	  inherits from different kind of constituents. (For instance
	  the SCycleBaseNTuple constituent can be replaced
	  while not touching the SCycleBaseExec class.)
	* Extended SInputData. It now holds a new kind of input
	  tree, called "persistent tree". This is used to describe
	  input trees from POOL based DPD files. The name of the
	  persistent tree is practically always "CollectionTree",
	  but it is configurable through XML nevertheless.
	* A new kind of property can be defined for the
	  <JobConfiguration>, <PyLibrary>. It is very similar to
	  the <Library> property, but it defines a Python module
	  that should be loaded by the framework at initialisation.
	* The EventView tree handling functions don't have to be
	  called separately by SCycleBaseExec anymore. They are
	  called internally in SCycleBaseNTuple by the functions
	  that used to only handle the regular input trees. (This
	  way the transient input trees can be handled just by
	  overwriting these functions.)

2007.11.26. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added something to SCycleBaseHist that I wanted to do
	  for a while now: the SCycleBaseHist::Hist(...)
	  function. It can be used to *quickly* retrieve
	  (1-dimensional) histograms from the output file. It
	  proved to be very useful for me when handling a lot
	  of output histograms. See the Doxygen documentation
	  for further details.:-)

2007.11.22. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a *lot* of Doxygen documentation to the code.
	  Added a new directory called "doc/" which contains a
	  single header (mainpage.h) by default, and in which
	  the HTML documentation is put by Doxygen when calling
	  "doxygen" in the current directory.
	* Added a file called "Doxyfile" that describes the
	  project to Doxygen. It is currently configured to use
	  a tool called "dot" to create the graphs for the
	  documentation. Unfortunately it is not available on
	  SLC by default, but it can easily be installed. To
	  disable the usage of "dot", change the line in the
	  configuration file

	    HAVE_DOT = YES

	  to

	    HAVE_DOT = NO

2007.11.20. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Disabled the "parameter-less" running of sframe_main.
	  Now one always has to define exactly one XML file on
	  the command prompt, else the usage help is printed.
	* Added the possibility to use a new feature of ROOT.
	  (Awailable in ROOT >= 5.17/04) This new feature makes
	  it possible to use a bit more complicated XML files
	  for configuring the job. It is only used when compiling
	  against a proper ROOT version. (Pre-processor
	  conditional statements rule...)

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFrameCore" library.
	* The makefile also automatically compiles and links the
	  "sframe_main" executable. One shortcoming is that
	  "make clean" doesn't delete the executable...
	* Added appropriate headers with the SFrame authors to
	  all the files.
	* Used a little C++ magic in SCycleBase to make it impossible
	  for the users to call internal functions of the class that
	  they're not supposed to.
