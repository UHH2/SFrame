2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the re-organised SFrame
	  source.
	* It is divided into 3 separate libraries:
	  - SFrameCore: Holding the framework base classes that
	                normal users should not touch.
	  - SFramePlugIns: Holding useful tools for analysis.
	  - SFrameUser: Holding the user analysis code.
	* The idea is that the user can take the "user/" directory
	  as a starting point for creating an analysis in SFrame.
	  The directory can be copied out of its default location,
	  after being modified it can be checked in to the users
	  private CVS space, so can be handled pretty independently
	  of the rest of the SFrame code.
	* Not obvious how to write multiple user libraries that include
	  header files from each other at the moment.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-00
