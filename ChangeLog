2008.12.01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added SFrame-PROOF development code to the
	  SFrame-PROOF-branch branch.
	* The code is *very* experimental at this point.
	* The NEventsSkip functionality will have to be added later
	  on to the branch.
	* SFrameARA will not work with the branch at this point
	* PROOF-Lite does work when compiled against
	  ROOT >= 5.21/06

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new XML property for <InputData>, "NEventsSkip".
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-07

2008.03.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Now linking sframe_main against libutil
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-05

2008.02.15. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new python script/module.
	  (sframe_create_cycle.py/CycleCreators.py) They can be
	  used to quickly add a new analysis cycle to an already
	  existing user library.

	  There has been such code in the old SFrame CVS tree,
	  but that never got updated to the new features.
	  This implementation is maybe a little shorter, but
	  not by much... :-P
	* Added Wolfgang's suggestion to
	  SCycleBaseNTuple::OpenInputFile.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-04

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended SCycleBaseConfig
	* Fixed compilation problem from SCycleBaseNTuple
	* Extended FirstCycle
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-03

2008.02.08. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new feature to sframe_input.py: It is now able to
	  create <In> XML nodes from "data" files. (I used it
	  with streamtest files.) When using this option,
	  the user doesn't have to define a cross-section.

2008.02.04. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing compilation against 32-bit ROOT binaries on a
	  64-bit system.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-02

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added python script/module. The script can be used to
	  create <In ... /> XML nodes for analyses in an
	  automatised way.
	* Changed how the Doxygen documentation is made. The
	  Doxyfile file is now in the main directory, and it
	  requires version 1.5.4 of Doxygen. (Available under
	  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/doxygen/1.5.4.)
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-01

2008.01.25. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Introduced all the changes needed by SFrameARA.
	* All the changes should be backward compatible with
	  existing user code.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-00

2007.11.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small updates to core/ and user/
	* Version used for writing the documentation on the TWiki
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-01

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the re-organised SFrame
	  source.
	* It is divided into 3 separate libraries:
	  - SFrameCore: Holding the framework base classes that
	                normal users should not touch.
	  - SFramePlugIns: Holding useful tools for analysis.
	  - SFrameUser: Holding the user analysis code.
	* The idea is that the user can take the "user/" directory
	  as a starting point for creating an analysis in SFrame.
	  The directory can be copied out of its default location,
	  after being modified it can be checked in to the users
	  private CVS space, so can be handled pretty independently
	  of the rest of the SFrame code.
	* Not obvious how to write multiple user libraries that include
	  header files from each other at the moment.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-00
