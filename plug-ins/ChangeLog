2014.05.23 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Hiding the auto-generated .pcm file from SVN.

2013.12.02 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * Making the PROOF files aware of the ROOTPROOFLIBDIR environment variable,
     which can be used to specify a common library directory that should be
     searched for libraries on a PROOF cluster with a shared filesystem.

2013.11.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing SSummedVar after the changes made in ISCycleBaseHist.

2012.12.13 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * Updated the documentation of practically all the files.
   * Modified the source text formatting a bit for it to fit into 80 column
     editors.

2012.12.03 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * Added the new extra "inFile" option to SToolBase::Book(...). It was just
     an oversight now to put the option in so far.

2012.06.07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * "Stole" a header from the ATLAS offline code, and added it under
     plug-ins/include/FPCompare.h. It holds function and functors that can be
     used to implement safe floating point comparisons. (Sidestepping an x87
     "bug".)

2012.04.21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * Updated SH1.icc not to use <cmath> anymore. There is no good reason for
     this, just that Xcode seems to go crazy over <cmath>, so my IDE is happier
     if I use TMath.h instead.

2012.04.12 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
   * Updated BUILD.sh not to compile the code when running on PROOF-Lite

2011.10.11 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified SToolBase to make it possible to generate
	  dictionaries for tools inheriting from it. The modifications
	  came from Massimiliano.

2011.06.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the missing virtual destructor to SToolBaseT.
	  (Didn't get a complaint on MacOS X... :-P)

2011.06.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Followed the developments of SCycleBaseHist with
	  SToolBaseT.
	* Added some functions to SToolBaseT that were missing so
	  far. (Coming from SCycleBaseNTuple.)

2010.12.01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended the documentation for SSummedVar a bit, stating that
	  users should always mark such variables as transient when
	  using new ROOT versions.

2010.08.06. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified SToolBase to be much more flexible than it was.
	  This will make it possible to extend it much more
	  easily in SFrameARA.

2010.08.04. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a non-const version of the Write(...) function to
	  SH1. This shouldn't change the functioning of the code at
	  all, but it should make GCC happier.

2010.08.02. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created the new SOutputVariables class, which works in an
	  analogous way to SInputVariables.
	* Fixed the friend relations of SToolBase to make it possible
	  to use SInputVariable and SOutputVariable classes with such
	  a parent as well.

2010.06.30. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* The helper classes are now using the message macros from
	  SLogger.h.

2010.05.05. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the SH1::Fill(...) function to throw an exception
	  when it receives a NaN value. (Instead of plainly crashing.)
	  This should make debugging a little easier, as the code now
	  reports which histogram received the NaN value.

2010.04.08. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created the SToolBase class: This class could be used to
	  create "smart classes" easily. These tool classes can use
	  much of the same convenience functionality as their parent
	  cycles can. But of course they have to be attached to a
	  parent cycle, to make it possible to run them.
	* Created the SInputVariables class: This base class should make
	  it simpler to create classes that serve the only purpose to
	  collect input data variables. This design makes it simple
	  to pass around input variables between different parts of the
	  analysis code. (After a long circle we came back to the
	  original design of SFrame...)

2009.11.20. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the possibility to use various std::map types with
	  SSummedVar. These can be very handy when calculating
	  event selection efficiencies for instance.

2009.09.15. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new class: SH1
	  It's a light-weight 1-dimensional histogram class. It
	  can be used to speed up analysis cycles a little.

2009.01.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new class: SSummedVar
	  It can be used to wrap different kinds of integer numbers,
	  making it possible to "count things" when running in
	  PROOF mode. For an example see the FirstCycle class.

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a lot of Doxygen documentation to the code, as
	  it is now also parsed.

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFramePlugIns" library.
	* The package should be a collection of useful tools
	  built on top of SFrame/ROOT.
	* As a placekeeper, I added the good old SParticle class
	  to the library.
