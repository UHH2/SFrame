	* Disabled the "parameter-less" running of sframe_main.
	  Now one always has to define exactly one XML file on
	  the command prompt, else the usage help is printed.
	* Added the possibility to use a new feature of ROOT.
	  (Awailable in ROOT >= 5.17/04) This new feature makes
	  it possible to use a bit more complicated XML files
	  for configuring the job. It is only used when compiling
	  against a proper ROOT version. (Pre-processor
	  conditional statements rule...)

	* Created first version of the "SFrameCore" library.
	* The makefile also automatically compiles and links the
	  "sframe_main" executable. One shortcoming is that
	  "make clean" doesn't delete the executable...
	* Added appropriate headers with the SFrame authors to
	  all the files.
	* Used a little C++ magic in SCycleBase to make it impossible
	  for the users to call internal functions of the class that
	  they're not supposed to.
