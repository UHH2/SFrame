	* Changed the location of the example input file in
	  FirstCycle_config.xml. The file is put on AFS now,
	  so anyone could run the example out of the box.

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFrameUser" library.
	* The package holds two example analysis cycles that
	  can be good starting points for newcomers.

	  XML configuration files a bit.
