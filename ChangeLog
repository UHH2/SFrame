2009.08.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Validated the code a bit more, and maximised the number of
	  messages that the worker nodes print about their memory
	  consumption. (A maximum of approximately 10 messages per
	  query now.)
	* Cleaned out the unnecessary things from sframe_main.cxx
	* Tagging this version as SFrame-03-00-00

2009.08.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Merging SFrame-PROOF-branch back into the trunk.
	* The code now compiles and runs, but I'll only tag it once
	  I read through the code carefully. Shouldn't trust
	  "svn merge" too much...

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified Makefile.common and PARHelpers.py to work with
	  MacOS X + ROOT 5.24. Although I consider this modification
	  a decrease in the flexibility of the compilation system...
	* Removed "-g" from the compilation options, because debug
	  information should not be needed all the time.
	* Tested the code both with 5.24 (where MacOS X shows the same
	  problems as SLC5 now...) and 5.22. Both with PROOF-lite
	  and a proper PROOF cluster (which is running the trunk
	  version of ROOT), in all possible combinations of the above.

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* "Backported" the code to work with ROOT 5.22d. (Should work
	  with all 5.22X versions...)
	* Tested the basic functionality on SLC5 with gcc43.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-11, since it should already
	  be usable with this ROOT version.

2009.08.26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Checking in some preliminary python scripts for managing
	  data sets on a PROOF cluster. The scripts are not at all
	  production-ready yet...

2009.08.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* I believe I found the main memory leak in
	  SCycleController::ExecuteNextCycle(...). Thanks a lot
	  for Gerri Ganis for his help.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-10

2009.07.20 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small changes here and there while looking for more memory
	  leaks.

2009.06.23 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* First modifications in the SVN repository...
	* Fixed multiple memory leaks in SFrameCore
	* Disabled compilation warnings when running an SFrame job
	  on a real PROOF cluster.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-09

2009.06.15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing a crash in SCycleBaseExec...

2009.06.15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added some modifications to try to make sure that all files
	  that are opened, are really all closed. Even though the
	  old code should've done this already...
	* Not tagging at the moment, first Akira should test if this
	  solved his problems...

2009.06.08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made the PAR file creation in Makefile.common smarter.
	  Now the PAR files are only re-made if the respective
	  shared library has to be re-made. Thanks to Akira for
	  the suggestion!
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-08

2009.05.13 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified SLogWriter such that it now only prints the
	  output in different colours if it's being printed on
	  the console. This makes the logfiles easier to read.
	  Unfortunately it also has the sideeffect that all output
	  from the worker nodes appears colourless...
	* Changed SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable so that it now
	  returns whether it was successful or not.
	* Thanks to Alexander Mann for both of these suggestions!
	* Removed a hard-coded "include/" from Makefile.common
	  and replaced it with "$(INCDIR)". Thanks to Mark Andrew
	  for pointing this out!
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-07

2009.05.06 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed SCycleBaseNTuple::ConnectVariable so that it now
	  it returns whether it was successful or not. Thanks to
	  Alexander Mann for the suggestion!
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-11

2009.04.07 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Simplified connecting to input branches which are arrays
	  of primitives. The standard ConnectVariable(...) function
	  could not be used easily for this.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-06

2009.03.27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the SCycleBaseHist::Hist(...) function to be a bit more
	  robust.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-05

2009.02.24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Cleaned up the example cycle configuration a bit.
	* Fixed a problem in SFileMerger where the code would crash
	  in case of not writing out any entries to the output TTrees.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-04

2009.01.22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Tested the code on a realistic PROOF setup after a long time
	  only running the code on PROOF-lite. This required some
	  changes in the temporary ntuple writing department, but
	  nothing serious.
	* Added a new Cycle property (ProofWorkDir) to make the
	  temporary file handling as flexible as possible.
	* Updated the FirstCycle example to use this new property.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-02

2009.01.21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added some more documentation
	* Fixed some problems which only surfaced when using the code
	  in a realistic analysis.
	* Now the worker nodes print messages with the same verbosity
	  level as the master node.

2009.01.08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a *lot* of new code. I'll only try to list all new
	  features here, I'll probably forget a few...
	* The weighting should now work correctly even when running
	  on PROOF.
	* The meaning of the InputData Type and Version properties
	  have changed a bit. Now you can set both properties to any
	  string. (You have to set Type="data" to get 1.0 for weight.)
	  The InputData-s are only treated to be the same if both their
	  type and version is the same. This makes it possible to have
	  different output files like this for instance:
	  <InputData Type="data" Version="Muon_run8XXXX" ...>
	  <InputData Type="data" Version="Egamma_run8xxxx" ... >
	* PROOF now creates temporary output files for the output
	  ntuples. This is a relatively new feature in PROOF, and
	  required quite a bit of coding on the SFrame part... :-/
	  All other output types are still kept in memory until being
	  written out on the client machine at the end of an InputData.
	* The behaviour with defining multiple InputData nodes with the
	  same type and version is now the same as it is in "classic"
	  SFrame. (The luminosities of the separate IDs are added up,
	  and their content ends up in the same output file.) However
	  the implementation is radically different. Instead of keeping
	  an output file open when switching to a new ID, the old
	  (previously closed) file is appended with the contents of the
	  new ID when the processing of that ID finishes on the PROOF
	  cluster. There's quite a bit of ROOT magic involved...
	* Output file names should resemble the old type of names a bit
	  more now.
	* Only tested the code with GCC 4.3 and ROOT 5.22 on SL5 for
	  the moment. ROOT 5.22 is a strict requirement for
	  PROOF-Lite to work.
	* Tagging as SFrame-PROOF-branch-01

2009.01.05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added GCC 4.3 related fixes.
	* Updated example configuration files to work with
	  ROOT 5.20 and 5.22 by default.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-09

2008.12.01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added SFrame-PROOF development code to the
	  SFrame-PROOF-branch branch.
	* The code is *very* experimental at this point.
	* The NEventsSkip functionality will have to be added later
	  on to the branch.
	* SFrameARA will not work with the branch at this point
	* PROOF-Lite does work when compiled against
	  ROOT >= 5.21/06

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new XML property for <InputData>, "NEventsSkip".
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-07

2008.03.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Now linking sframe_main against libutil
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-05

2008.02.15. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new python script/module.
	  (sframe_create_cycle.py/CycleCreators.py) They can be
	  used to quickly add a new analysis cycle to an already
	  existing user library.

	  There has been such code in the old SFrame CVS tree,
	  but that never got updated to the new features.
	  This implementation is maybe a little shorter, but
	  not by much... :-P
	* Added Wolfgang's suggestion to
	  SCycleBaseNTuple::OpenInputFile.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-04

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended SCycleBaseConfig
	* Fixed compilation problem from SCycleBaseNTuple
	* Extended FirstCycle
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-03

2008.02.08. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added new feature to sframe_input.py: It is now able to
	  create <In> XML nodes from "data" files. (I used it
	  with streamtest files.) When using this option,
	  the user doesn't have to define a cross-section.

2008.02.04. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing compilation against 32-bit ROOT binaries on a
	  64-bit system.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-02

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added python script/module. The script can be used to
	  create <In ... /> XML nodes for analyses in an
	  automatised way.
	* Changed how the Doxygen documentation is made. The
	  Doxyfile file is now in the main directory, and it
	  requires version 1.5.4 of Doxygen. (Available under
	  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/doxygen/1.5.4.)
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-01

2008.01.25. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Introduced all the changes needed by SFrameARA.
	* All the changes should be backward compatible with
	  existing user code.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-01-00

2007.11.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small updates to core/ and user/
	* Version used for writing the documentation on the TWiki
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-01

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the re-organised SFrame
	  source.
	* It is divided into 3 separate libraries:
	  - SFrameCore: Holding the framework base classes that
	                normal users should not touch.
	  - SFramePlugIns: Holding useful tools for analysis.
	  - SFrameUser: Holding the user analysis code.
	* The idea is that the user can take the "user/" directory
	  as a starting point for creating an analysis in SFrame.
	  The directory can be copied out of its default location,
	  after being modified it can be checked in to the users
	  private CVS space, so can be handled pretty independently
	  of the rest of the SFrame code.
	* Not obvious how to write multiple user libraries that include
	  header files from each other at the moment.
	* Tagging as SFrame-02-00-00
