2009.01.05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Modified FirstCycle_config.xml and SecondCycle_config.xml to
	  work with ROOT 5.20 and newer versions by default. If you
	  use an older version of ROOT, you should modify the configuration
	  files as instructed in the comments, to run the example
	  cycles.

2008.10.14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added example usage of "NEventsSkip" to FirstCycle_config.xml.

2008.02.11. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended FirstCycle to give examples of how to use
	  boolean properties.

2008.02.01. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Very small changes in the documentation...

2007.11.21. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the location of the example input file in
	  FirstCycle_config.xml. The file is put on AFS now,
	  so anyone could run the example out of the box.

2007.11.13. Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created first version of the "SFrameUser" library.
	* The package holds two example analysis cycles that
	  can be good starting points for newcomers.
	* Cleanded-up and extended the descriptions in the
	  XML configuration files a bit.
