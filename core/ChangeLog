	* Created first version of the "SFrameCore" library.
	* The makefile also automatically compiles and links the
	  "sframe_main" executable. One shortcoming is that
	  "make clean" doesn't delete the executable...
	* Added appropriate headers with the SFrame authors to
	  all the files.
	* Used a little C++ magic in SCycleBase to make it impossible
	  for the users to call internal functions of the class that
	  they're not supposed to.
